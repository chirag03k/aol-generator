# Query Completion

I use *n_grams* to generate queries based on the AOL data release.

Usage:
Simply run it, and optionally supply an argument if you want to start the query with a specific word or phrase. 

```
$ python3 query_complete.py
purple martins in hauppauge real etate

$ python3 query_complete.py "I want"
I want you vancouver wa pizza longmont colorado millionares
```
